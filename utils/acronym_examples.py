# list of user defined acronym list:
# * for example if you add to this file "TACH": "tachycardia":
#    'John has TACH' becomes 'John has TACH tachycardia '
# * if the key (word to be replace) contains any uppercase symbol, the matching
#    will be case sensitive, otherwise matching will be case insensitive
# * the dictionnary name has to be the argument `acronym_list`
# * avoid using stop words as they will not be removed, for example :
#    "TNM": "tumor lymph node metastasis" instead of "tumor of the
#    lymph node with metastasis"
# * regexp matching is supported, this allows very complex string replacement
#    rules
# * acronyms replacement are not recursive BUT will be applied in order of
#    appearance, for example :
#            "HIV": "human immuno defficiency virus AIDS"
#            "AIDS": "acquired immuno defficiency syndrome"
#    will turns 'HIV' into 'HIV human immunon defficiency virus AIDS acquired
#    immuno defficiency syndrome'. This can be good or bad depending on your
#    usage
